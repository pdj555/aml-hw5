# Daily Summaries

## Summary

Daily summary data provide access to comma-delimited (CSV) files of daily maxima, minima, averages, and other useful quantities based on data from the Oklahoma Mesonet. These data are used to produce Mesonet Climatological Data (MCD) products. In addition to the variables included on the MCDs, numerous others are available. The comma-delimited format allows for easy importation into spreadsheets.

Daily statistical data are computed for each Mesonet station and are available for the life of each station (generally starting January 1, 1994). Data reflect measurements taken from midnight to midnight Central Standard Time (CST).

Most measurements require a minimum percentage of observations for the day to be included in the calculations:
- **Total daily solar radiation** is calculated if 99% of the observations for the site and day are available.
- **Maximum wind gust, maximum heat index, and minimum wind chill** are calculated if at least 1 observation is available for the day.
- **Wind direction** data are only available when wind speed is greater than 2.5 mph.
- All other variables require at least 90% of the observations.
- Values between +/-990-999 indicate data are not available.
